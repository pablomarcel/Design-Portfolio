# Introduction

 In this document present the projects I've been working on at Paccar. 

**T680 Next Gen**

 One of the benefits of using a function is flexibility. By using a function multiple built-in python commands can be used and the docstring can be updated with information  about parameters and return values as applicable to those built-in functions (Root, R. Programming with Python, Module 07 Notes, page 2). The function allows for customization and code simplification at the same time. An example is shown in figure 1.

**New Medium Duty**

 Adding custom error handling to the python script aids in taking full control of the code as opposed to let python handle it. When python finds an exception at run time, the  program halts. The benefit of adding error handling is preventing the program from ending abruptly and informing the user that an exception has happened but in a controlled way (Dawson, M. Python Programming for Absolute Beginners, Cengage, 2010, page 205).  These are some of the exception types that can be used: IOError, IndexError, KeyError, NameError, SyntaxError, TypeError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionError (Dawson, M. Python Programming for Absolute Beginners, Cengage, 2010, page 207). An example is shown in figure 2. I created three custom exception classes based off the ‘Exception’ class. The string method is overridden to display targeted messages.

**TX-8 Transmission**

 Python can create an exception object whenever an error occurs. Having an object available allows for making inquiries about the object properties such as its ‘docstring’, its string representation, or the error type (Root, R. Programming with Python, Module 07 Notes, page 16).

**MY21 T680**

 Python can create an exception object whenever an error occurs. Having an object available allows for making inquiries about the object properties such as its ‘docstring’, its string representation, or the error type (Root, R. Programming with Python, Module 07 Notes, page 16).
